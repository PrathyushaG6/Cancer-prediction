#  Breast Cancer-prediction
The repository is a learning exercise to:

Apply the fundamental concepts of machine learning and deep learning for the available dataset.
Evaluate and interpret  results and justify my interpretation based on observed data set
Create notebooks that serve as computational records and document my thought process.

The analysis is divided into four sections, saved in juypter notebooks in this repository.

Identifying the problem and Data Sources
Exploratory Data Analysis
Pre-Processing the Data
Build model to predict breast cancer using the targeted output feature.
